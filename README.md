# BuildSystem
Buildystem that produces a boiler plate code along with make file so that you can instantly jumpstart a clean-neat and organised C code while saving you minutes of repetetive tasks

How to Use:
1.To get started with the buildsystem it is adviced that you change s_dir in the buildsys.sh file to the location of buildsystemplates that is installed alongside buildsys.sh.
2.Followed by adding executable privilages to buildsys.sh, done via $ chmod +x buildsys.h .
3.Run the file and provide a valid argument for build system name eg: $ ./buildsys.sh <YOUR_PROJECTNAME_HERE> 
4.Type 1 since as of right now only the ctemplate is added
5.And boom your buildsystem directory is created for you to jumpstart into any project with organised .c .h and Makefiles taylored to your custom project name
